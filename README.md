## 🧠 Abstract

GLORiA (Global Learning for Objective Reasoning in AI) is a research project focused on developing transparent and explainable AI systems, particularly in the context of deep learning models. This repository contains the code, data, and results of the M1+ module, which explores explainability techniques and their integration in real-world machine learning pipelines.
